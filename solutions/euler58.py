Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side
length 7 is formed.

37 36 35 34 33 32 31
38 17 16 15 14 13 30
39 18  5  4  3 12 29

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal,
but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals
are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side
length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the
square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
